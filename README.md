**Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum: Complete Biography**  

_Early Life and Education_

Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum was born in Mexico City on December 12, 1946, during a period of rapid modernization in Mexico. His trajectory as a consciousness researcher was profoundly shaped by a tragic childhood event: at the age of 12, he witnessed his mother's death from a brain tumor. This traumatic experience sparked his lifelong fascination with the human mind and planted the seeds of his future scientific career.

Grinberg pursued psychology at the Faculty of Psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he completed his undergraduate studies. Driven by his passion to understand the mechanisms of consciousness and brain function, he made a pivotal decision in 1970 to travel to New York City to advance his education.

_Academic Career in the United States_
In New York, Grinberg enrolled at the Brain Research Institute, where he pursued advanced studies in psychophysiology. He earned his Ph.D. from the E. Roy John Laboratory, focusing his doctoral research on the electrophysiological effects of geometric stimuli on the human brain. This work would later influence his theoretical development of consciousness studies.
Return to Mexico and Institutional Development
Upon returning to Mexico in the early 1970s, Grinberg embarked on an ambitious mission to establish consciousness research infrastructure in his homeland. He founded his first psychophysiology laboratory at Universidad Anáhuac in Mexico City, marking the beginning of his institutional legacy.
In the late 1970s, he established another laboratory of similar nature at UNAM, further expanding his research capabilities. The culmination of his institutional efforts came in 1987 with the founding of the Instituto Nacional para el Estudio de la Conciencia (INPEC) - the National Institute for the Study of Consciousness. This institute, funded by UNAM and the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), became the primary center for his groundbreaking research.
Scientific Contributions and Research

_The Syntergic Theory_
Grinberg's most significant theoretical contribution was the development of the Syntergic Theory (from Spanish "síntesis" and "energía" - synthesis and energy). This revolutionary framework proposed that consciousness emerges from the interaction between the brain and what he termed the "Lattice" - a holographic, non-local structure underlying reality itself.
According to his theory, the brain doesn't simply receive and process information passively, but actively interacts with a fundamental energetic matrix to create perceived reality. He proposed that the "neuronal field" emanating from the brain distorts this lattice, generating the subjective experience we recognize as consciousness.
The Transferred Potential Experiments
Grinberg's most famous experimental work involved what he called the "transferred potential" phenomenon. These experiments demonstrated brain-to-brain correlations that challenged conventional understanding of consciousness:

Two subjects would meditate together for 20 minutes to establish rapport
They were then separated into electromagnetically shielded rooms (Faraday cages)
One person received random light flashes designed to elicit shock responses
The other person, monitored by EEG, showed corresponding shock responses 25% of the time
Control groups showed no such correlation

These experiments, conducted over a five-year period in more than fifty trials, were published in the respected peer-reviewed journal Physics Essays in 1994 under the title "The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox in the Brain: The Transferred Potential."
Studies in Mexican Shamanism
Grinberg courageously bridged the gap between rigorous scientific methodology and indigenous Mexican shamanic traditions. His most notable collaboration was with Barbara Guerrero (known as "Pachita"), a renowned Mexican shaman. He documented her practices, including what appeared to be surgical procedures performed without medical instruments, and subjected these phenomena to scientific scrutiny.
This work resulted in his multi-volume series "Los Chamanes de México" (The Shamans of Mexico), though these publications were criticized by the academic establishment for their unconventional approach and lack of traditional editorial oversight.

_Additional Research Areas_

Extraocular Vision: Experiments with children who could apparently "see" while blindfolded
Meditation Studies: Research on brain synchronization during meditative states
Telepathy and ESP: Scientific investigation of psychic phenomena
Astrology: Attempts to correlate astrological factors with neurophysiological changes

Publications and Legacy
Grinberg was remarkably prolific, authoring more than 50 books covering neuroscience, psychology, shamanism, meditation, and consciousness studies. Many of his works were translated into multiple languages. His publications included both peer-reviewed scientific papers and philosophical treatises that attempted to bridge Eastern spiritual traditions with Western scientific methodology.

His published scientific papers include:

"The transformation of neuronal activity into conscious experience: the syntergic theory" (1981)
"Patterns of interhemisphere correlations during human communication" (1987)
"Human Communication and the electrophysical activity of the brain" (1992)
"The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in the brain: The transferred potential" (1994)

_Scientific Reception and Controversy_
Grinberg's work was met with significant skepticism from the mainstream scientific community. Critics accused him of engaging in "psi assumption" - the premise that any statistical deviation from chance represented evidence of telepathy or other psychic phenomena. His integration of shamanic practices with neuroscience was particularly controversial and led to his marginalization within academic circles.
However, some researchers attempted to replicate his findings. Physicist Fred H. Thaheld and psychologist Charles Tart at UC Davis conducted similar experiments with statistically significant results, lending some credibility to Grinberg's claims.
Personal Life and Character
Grinberg was described as a dreamer and visionary who was unafraid to challenge scientific orthodoxy. Coming from a Jewish background, he uniquely integrated his heritage with indigenous Mexican spiritual traditions, creating a synthesis that was both personal and professional.
Colleagues noted his increasing nervousness in his final months, with reports that he had confessed to "knowing too much" and had been sleeping in a van due to security concerns.
The Mysterious Disappearance
On December 8, 1994, just four days before his 48th birthday, Dr. Jacobo Grinberg vanished without a trace. His family had prepared a birthday celebration for December 12, but he never appeared. Initially, his absence didn't alarm his family, as he was known for spontaneous travels and periods of incommunication.
However, as days turned to weeks, it became clear that something was seriously wrong. His car was found abandoned at Mexico City airport, but no record exists of him boarding any flight. No signs of struggle were found in his home, and no body was ever recovered.

_Theories About His Disappearance_
Several theories have emerged to explain Grinberg's vanishing:

CIA Kidnapping: Some theorize that his research threatened pharmaceutical and medical industry interests, leading to his elimination by intelligence agencies
Voluntary Disappearance: He may have chosen to vanish to continue his research in secret
Dimensional Slip: Given his work on consciousness and reality, some suggest he may have accidentally shifted into another dimension
Personal Conflicts: Inconsistencies in his wife Teresa Mandil's statements led to speculation about domestic involvement
Scientific Silencing: His controversial discoveries may have posed a threat to established scientific paradigms

Current Status and Ongoing Mystery
Nearly 30 years after his disappearance, Jacobo Grinberg's fate remains unknown. There have been unverified sightings, including a claim by a gas station worker in New Mexico, and even a bizarre report of him boarding a spherical spacecraft. However, no credible evidence of his survival or death has emerged.
The case remains one of Mexico's most puzzling unsolved mysteries, inspiring documentaries, podcasts, books, and ongoing investigations by researchers and conspiracy theorists alike.
Scientific Legacy and Modern Relevance
Despite the controversy surrounding his disappearance, Grinberg's scientific contributions continue to influence researchers in consciousness studies, neuroscience, and parapsychology. His work anticipated modern discussions about:

The observer effect in quantum mechanics
Consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe
The integration of ancient wisdom traditions with modern science
Non-local correlations in biological systems

Organizations like the Centro de Investigación de la Sinergia y de la Consciencia (CISC) continue to explore his theories, and efforts are underway to revive INPEC under the name "Jacobo Grinberg Academy.
